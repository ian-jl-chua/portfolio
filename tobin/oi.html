        <p>
          Kia ora, my name is Ian. This is my portfolio to showcase some
          projects that I have been working on during my time at Dev Academy.

              <h3>SIMS Final Project</h3>
              <p>
                This is the final group project at Dev Academy. We have decided
                to create a Gartic phone like game that lets a player put in a
                prompt and another player draw the prompt that was given.
              </p>
              <h4>Learnings:</h4>
              <p>
                The importance of planning group projects and breaking task down
                to small parts, this helps with the distribution of workload. We
                as a group would also have liked to implement websockets and
                considering using Firebase as our database in future projects.

            <h3>Todo-Fullstack</h3>
            <p>
              This is a solo challenge at Dev Academy where we have to build
              Todo site using the Full Stack knowledge we have at the course.
            </p>
            <h4>Learnings:</h4>
            <p>
              It is quite challenging to build something from scratch, but I now
              know the 4 functions that are necessary in programming, CRUD. I
              would do one thing differently, which would be to plan out my
              backend database table and be aware of of how information is
              passed to my table. For example using (task_details as
              taskDetails)
            </p>
